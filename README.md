## Hi, I'm Elia ðŸ¦¦
I'm a 26-year-old self-taught programmer from Bern, CH.  
Solving everyday problems is what I'm most passionate about.  
I strongly believe in learning by doing.  
What I love is to iterate fast, try unconventional approaches, and I'm not afraid of doing a deep dive into new technology.  
Currently, I'm pursuing a CS bachelor's degree at the Bern University of Applied Sciences.  
Part-time, I work as an Embedded Software Engineer and Flutter freelancer.
