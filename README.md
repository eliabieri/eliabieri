## Hi, I'm Elia ðŸ¦¦
I'm a 27-year-old self-taught programmer from Bern, CH.  
Solving everyday problems is what I'm most passionate about.  
I strongly believe in learning by doing.  
What I love is to iterate fast, try unconventional approaches, and I'm not afraid of doing a deep dive into new technology.  
Recently, I've finished by Bachelor in Computer Science at the Bern University of Applied Sciences.  
I work as a Fullstack-Developer part-time and also do freelance work. I make apps for different platforms using Flutter.
